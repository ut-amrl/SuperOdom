## Super Odometry

### Alphatruck UT AMRL Changes

The Alphatruck branch includes a UT AMRL-specific integration layer on top of the base Super Odometry code. The main changes are:

- Replaced the old mixed calibration/manual-rotation path with a TF/URDF-driven alignment flow for Alphatruck. IMU and LiDAR frames are derived from `base_link`, `imu_frame`, and `lidar_frame`, and rectified helper frames are published for the physical sensor frames.
- Moved the odometry frame publishing to `map -> base_link` so the full robot URDF subtree moves consistently in the map frame, while keeping rectified LiDAR/IMU helper frames for debugging and sensor interpretation.
- Improved startup/runtime robustness by waiting for required TFs instead of failing fast, buffering LiDAR scans until slightly-late IMU data arrives, and cleaning up several branch-merge regressions in IMU preintegration and frame handling.
- Added a live Alphatruck terminal dashboard (`scripts/superodom_dashboard.py`) that shows LiDAR/IMU rates, odometry, TF readiness, optimization stats, distance traveled, CPU/RAM usage, and related runtime health in a continuously updating terminal view.

Super Odometry is a high-performance odometry library designed for robotics applications. It integrates advanced algorithms for real-time localization and mapping, supporting a wide range of sensors.

## How to Run the localization mode? 
Please change the yaml file 
```
        localization_mode: true             # if true, localization mode is on; Otherwise, SLAM mode is on  
        read_pose_file: false        # read the txt pose as the initial pose for localization
        init_x: 13.983960            # initial pose from yaml file for localization
        init_y: 1.305790
        init_z: 0.002673
        init_roll: 0.0
        init_pitch: 0.0
        init_yaw: -1.150664 
```
## Test Sample 

```
ros2 bag play cic_office_stopping.db3 --start-offset 50  
ros2 launch super_odometry arize_slam.launch.py 

```
## Load the start_pose.txt (below are format samples) 
```  
timespan x        y        z      roll     pitch     yaw
50s 13.983960 1.305790 0.002673   0.00     0.0 -1.150664
```
## Put the start_pose.txt same directory of groundtruth map (pointcloud_local.pcd)
